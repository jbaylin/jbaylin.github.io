My passion is using data and automation to drive value. I've worked on several sides of the table, covering technology as a reporter, industry analyst, investor and operator.

I began my career as a reporter with Bloomberg News in Washington, DC where I covered technology and telecommunications policy in the early 2000s at the start of the mobile communications revolution.

My data-driven style and investor focus led to invites to the White House Correspondent's Dinner and Congressional Internet Caucus and a career as an industry analyst and investor for Legg Mason Wood Walker and SAC Capital Advisors LP I served as a Portfolio Manager focused on investment opportunities in the wireless, software, PC and gaming industries.

After leaving the Wall Street, and beginning a new adventure out west, I founded Velocity Growth Inc., an Austin-based, data and automation company focused on robotic process automation, data analytics and visualization. We work with Fortune 100 clients to modernize business processes and improve how they work with data. We're working on the next generation of automation tools to develop cognitive automation and data-driven workflows.
